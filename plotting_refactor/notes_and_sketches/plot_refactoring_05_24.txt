plot refactoring meeting 24.05.2024

arbitrary number of plots in one subplot window? e.g. 2x2?

polydispersity subplot for single parameters

for a trend: show subplots all in one subplot? like in a grid?

dataselector tree structure -move data around
sasview drag and drop mechanism for dataexplorer droppable data load widget
SAS qtgui mainwindow


mockup for subplots in one minor subplot window

2dviewing for data and fit and residuals, 3 of them side by side?
datatab - only data very big
fittab - data and fit
residualstab - all three

dockable possibility for tabs and subtabs




lin scale for the residuals



2d plotting different 2d scaling for different detectors on the same instrument
