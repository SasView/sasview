demo integration into sasview:

what is needed?
DataIDs from DataViewer/DataCollector, where are these saved in SasView?
What does the current displaying system look like?

How is a fit linked with the underlying data?
How are residuals linked?
How is polydispersity linked?
First layer of the model QStandardItemModel would be Data nodes
	children of these nodes would be e.g. the polydispersity, fit, residuals, etc.


Relation datasets/fitpages <--> existing plots?
How is the current logic behind plotting something new and replotting an existing plot
Checking if certain id already exists in the model/the dictionary for plotted objects

plotting tools for 1d and 2d exist and can keep functioning that way?
They just produce QWidgets that can be embedded inside the tabs afterwards
GuiManager-filesWidget.plotData creates an instance of PlotterWidget, which is a QWidget and


Where are the QWidgets from the Plotting generated? Where is explicitly show() stated?

dataID generation is in sas.qtgui.MainWindow.DataManager on line 124
The ID is a cocatenated string of the data object name 
(another GUI-only element that will move to sasdata) and 
1 plus the time stamp when SasView​ was loaded, not when the data file was loaded. 
The time stamp will be relative to the data load time, 
not the loader instance creation time when fully implemented into 
the sasdata object.


What is a model?
How can the plot for a model with a certain name already exist in the GuiUtils,
if the plotRequested Signal has not been emitted in the first place?
Why is _requestPlots applying plot.plot_role != DataRole.ROLE_DATA and only giving signals where this is not true/true?
Where does self.communicate.plotRequestedSignal go? What does this signal invoke?
	self.communicate is coming from the parent through initialize globals
	in initializeGlobals, the self.communicate = self.parent.communicate
	communicate comes from GuiUtils.Communicate()?
	How is this initialized if i create a new fitpage by hitting new fitpage?
	Where is the original GuiUtils coming from? -maybe from GuiManager?






Tree of what happens if python run.py is executed:
run.py
  run.__main__
    sas.cli.main
      sas.qtgui.MainWindow.MainWindow.run_sasview()
	QApplication is setup
	QtReactor is installed -> sasview can then listen to client/server calls
		and process them. 
		this is handled in sas.qtgui.Utilities.ReactorCore.install(),
		where install is only defined at the very bottom and is dependent
		on the system the user is using to start sasview (win32 or else?)
	mainwindow is initialized with mainwindow = MainSasViewWindow():
		self.guimanager = GuiManager(self) (it says main sassview window functionality itself)
			ALOT of stuff is done and a lot of stuff is imported
			self._datamanger = DataManager()
			self.addWidgets()
			What signal callbacks? l.106
				addCallbacks() l.670
					self.communicate = GuiUtils.Communicate()
					a big bunch of signals that are connected with methods
					e.g. self.communicate.plotRequestedSignal.connect(self.showPlot)
						showPlot(self, plot, id)
							self.filesWidget.displayData(plot, id)
			What Categories? 
				All categories are listed in (user folder)
				~/sasview/categories.json and are built there
				by the sas.qtgui.utilities.categoryinstaller.categoryinstaller
				And all the existing models come from 
				sas.sascalc.fit.models.ModelManager.cat_model_list()
					this gives back a listed variant of all models
					that are existing in the standard library. but it only goes through
					sasmodels.sasmodels.sasview_model.load_standard_models() (and before it goes through sasview.src.sas.sascalc.fit.models.ModelManagerBase and ModelManagers
			what action triggers? l116
			


Where does the data come from?
DataManager manages all the data that is loaded from a certain path and the ones
from creation at loading time
DataManager.create_gui_data can receive data from loader and create a data to use for guiframe
This will depend on Data2D and Data1D objects from PlotterData
