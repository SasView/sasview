What will the Window with all the tabs for plots be in terms of implementation?
	Is the window permanent? Like a perspective for instance?
	Is it belonging to the DataExplorerWindow?

Same lifetime as SasView
Showable and Hideable when opening other perspectives such as the invariant
All the data should pass through the dataexplorer, plotwidget is owned by dataexplorer
QStandardItemModels are used in the DataExplorer.py to keep the loaded data and the theory models
QStandardItemModels can store data so that i can be directly accessed through qt (like a tree structure)
Track the dictionary, as the dictionary changes, change the model as well

Follow the model and the theory_model from DataExplorerWindow throughout 
other parts of the code and keep track of what is happening to it, how it is accessed
and how it is edited



How does the checking for an existing tab with locals() work? l.1206 sas.qtgui.MainWindow.DataExplorer
locals as keeping track of what has been declared in this method call

Is the data manager really redundant and are all the functionalities moved to GuiManager?
Qt is able to stream stuff without carrying a pointer to the Datamanager everywhere it is needed


Does it work that create_gui_data creates a new Data1D or Data2D element and parses the data into these
items? then the new_plot items can be worked with and it can also have an id

Communicate class in GuiUtils can collect signals from parts of the codes 
where signals are not processed in the same class but throughout different classes
