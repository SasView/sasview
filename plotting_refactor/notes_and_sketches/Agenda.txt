Possible Todos for the demo: (I will not put effort into realizing these, just ideas and corrections)
1 Residuals for a fit need to be plotted beneath the Fit and therefore the grid structure of the plotting needs change
2 Real data linking could be something to look into (right now, there is only the identifier)
3 Dragging modifiers across the PlotTreeWidget causes trouble, because it does not autoscroll for whatever reason
    This could maybe be fixed with using a debugger
    It is possible to start the application normally and connect a debugger to the running instance afterwards
4 Delete button for modifiers

Current working branch for the integration of the demo into SasView is: plotting_refactor_integration
This branch (plotting_refactor_tabs) is with a standalone example in the plotting_refactor folder
    To start the demo, plotting_refactor/MainWindow.py needs to be executed


Other todos that were mentioned and could need integration in SasView in general:
The button for killing a Fitpage is way too small when executing SasView in a remote windows/linux instance
    Is there the possibility to have a prompt if the current Fitpage should really be closed?
    The showing of this prompt could be enabled/disabled in the settings

Lionel had a request with integration of a functionality similar to this:
https://github.com/criosx/molgroups/tree/main


Information regarding SasView that helps to understand the plotting process a little better:
PlotterWidget extends PlotterBase (PlotterWidget is a class in the file Plotter.py)
PlotterBase extends QWidget (uses for example QWidget.show or QWidget.showNormal)
PlotterBase gets its manager from PlotterWidget
PlotterWidget is instantiated in DataExplorerWindow method plotData (ll.1205)
DataExplorerWindow is given as the parent and the manager to the PlotterWidget
DataExplorerWindow has the MainWindow as its parent, the GuiManager as its guimanager and the GuiManager._data_manager as its manager

GuiManager.communicate is an instance of GuiUtils.Communicate()
GuiUtils.Communicate is a utility class for tracking the Qt Signals and connecting all of them to the right end
GuiUtils.Communicate extends QtCore.QObject. This class defines all the signals that are needed and processed (ll.83f.)
Signals are connected to everything in GuiManager.addCallbacks which executed when instantiating the GuiManager
    in the start of the SasView MainWindow (MainWindow.py)


Short overview on the plotting process:
What happens when clicking the "Plot" button in the FittingWidget in Sasview?
(1) FittingWidget.py -> onPlot -> showPlot/showTheoryPlot -> _requestPlots -> goes to tabbedPlotWidget among other things
    -> throws Signal to GuiManager
(2) Signal for Guimanager.showPlotFromName or Guimanager.showPlot redirects to
    to DataExplorerWidget.displayData or DataExplorerWidget.displayDataByName
(3) displayData ends in either active_plots.showNormal(4.1) or plotData(4.2) or updatePlot(4.3) or appendOrUpdatePlot(4.4)
(4.1) active_plots.showNormal is just a QWidget method that shows the Widget in its restored original size
(4.2) plotData creates a PlotterWidget instance and sets the item of it to the given item of the method (DataExplorer ll.1205)
(4.3) updatePlot goes to PlotterWidget.replacePlot:
        This updates the bookkeeping dictionary self.active_plots, where all the PlotterWidget items that are currently
        needed are saved
(4.4) appendOrUpdatePlot checks if the given plot already exists in the plot_dict of the PlotterWidget and depending on
        that, it either uses PlotterWidget.plot or PlotterWidget.replacePlot

Strategy for integration of the demo (at first)

Using methods that are already existing in SasView to feed all of the existing infrastructure
    into the new TabbedPlotWidget
Therefore there have to be places in the code where existing classes like for example DataExplorer, Plotter,
    PlotterBase, GuiManager, FittingWidget are communicating with the new TabbedPlotWidget and tell them about the
    requested plots and all the other information that is provided when fitting/simulating something.
    These places in the code will feed the TabbedPlotWidget.

Example: displayData is used as a method not to plot something directly but to manage what should be plotted and
then give all that is needed to another method that plots. This can be used to not only plot in the original infra-
structure, but also plot the same in the TabbedPlotWidget

Therefore, some of the classes can interact with tabbedPlotWidget (which is a variable/object of GuiManager right now)
and tell it to do something. The classes therefore interact via its parent with self.parent.tabbedPlotWidget or similar

In order to use the existing infrastructure, it is important to understand the reason behind all the methods that are
included into the plotting process and then understand how this can be used to feed all the needed information for
a similar plotting behaviour in the TabbedPlotWidget.

Overview: How to get to the TabbedFittingWidget from some classes that might need access:
    from Dataexplorer: self.parent.tabbedPlotWidget
    from Plotter: self.parent.parent.tabbedPlotWidget
    from PlotterBase: self.parent.parent.tabbedPlotWidget
    from GuiManager: self.tabbedPlotWidget


Dictionaries for plot management:
DataExplorerWindow.active_plots: all of the PlotterWidget instances are added in here to keep track of the windows?
PlotterWidget.plot_dict: keep track of all the datasets that have been printed in this particular window, so that no
    other window with the same dataset is displayed? (this is just a conjecture at the moment)

Structure of the Subtabs(which extends QTabWidget):
-> Tabs are DockContainers(QMainWindows)
-> setting the widget of the DockContainers with the docking zone to CanvasWidgets(QWidgets)
-> CanvasWidgets are filled with layouts that have only one widget at the moment: a ClickableCanvas(FigureCanvasQtAgg)
-> ClickableCanvas has the figure and extends a FigureCanvasQtAgg that can act upon events on the canvas like clicking

Problem/Challenge: The figure for the canvas and the layout for the CanvasWidget(which can include a matplotlib
    navigation toolbar if this is needed) have to be there before creating all the objects. Then one can give the layout
    and the figure into the creation and set them this way

Problem/Challenge: Existing Axes objects from Matplotlib that come with all the other handy stuff (title, labels, ...)
cannot be transferred to other figures very easily. Therefore, the created Axes from the Plotter cannot just be
given back up the stream and then be integrated into the TabbedPlotWidget
    Possible solution: When plotting something in the TabbedPlotWidget, just create an axes and feed it into the
    plotting functionality of the Plotter afterwards. Then, all the steps are made on the right axes (again)
Does this solution need to know, how many plots there are beforehand?


Problems with the current solution of with plotting on both axes at the same time:
1 In one of the Axes, Data and Fit are plotted twice
2 Legends are breaking stuff with subplots because of the width of them
3 The first plot seems to be empty always
    -> This has maybe something to do with showing Fit+Data on another axes and thus this gets ignored?
    -> For example when fitting a Data1d: for the merged fit and dataset plot, the for loop in plot dats is executed
        twice instead of only once, because there is only one axes for it in there
        this is also the case for the normal axes that exists in the qwidget, but it leads to too many axes being produced
        by using len(plots) itself as an indicator for how many axes need to be generated in SubTabs

    Solution could be: first iterating over the len(plots and check in there, how many plots are really needed
4 2d plots do not work at all


SubTabs need to be actually applied, right now, all plots are plotted in the first SubTab, but the SubTabs as a
    QTabWidget are not actually used, everything is just stored in the first one.
    This possibly also means, that parts of the code with the figure need to be refactored already, since
    every Tab in the SubTab would need its own figure which could be complicated to be accessed through all the layers
    from the QTabWidget SubTabs itself.
appendOrUpdatePlot in DataExplorer needs refactoring to work with the TabbedPlotWidget
