1 modifier colormap applicable on 2d data
2 residuals subplot on left side for big one? how to do this?
3 maybe have a look at the data links from lucas example
4 dragging modifiers across the treewidget with scrolling
5 delete button for modifiers
6 grey out the area that is docked out currently to generate some user feedback
7 killing fitpage tabs


what are future functionalities that can be built in to this?
slicers?
publication ready plots? or close to?


explore how difficult it is to integrate the functionalities from now into the 
existing sasview


have a look at colormap.py in sasview/src/sas/qtgui/Plotting/ColorMap.py

revert back to the earlier state by button?
kill a fittab with out prompt? maybe settings?
