2 residuals subplot on left side for big one? how to do this?
3 maybe have a look at the data links from lucas example
4 dragging modifiers across the treewidget with scrolling
    try with debugger and
    start sasview normally and connect a debugger manually
5 delete button for modifiers

what are future functionalities that can be built in into this?
slicers?
publication ready plots? or close to?

keep the dataviewer alive while transfering to sasview?

keep a branch alive where everything is working properly and it is not
destroyed :D

explore how difficult it is to integrate the functionalities from now into the 
existing sasview


have a look at colormap.py in sasview/src/sas/qtgui/Plotting/ColorMap.py

revert back to the earlier state by button?
kill a fittab with out prompt? maybe settings?
    onProjectLoad, onApplicationExit
    open Issue with this- settings option for are you sure you want to kill this fit tab


Lionels request regarding this repository:

how can the current functionality be processed in sasview? new perspective that is the tabbed plotwidget,
which processes signals and plots by references to model indexes?
