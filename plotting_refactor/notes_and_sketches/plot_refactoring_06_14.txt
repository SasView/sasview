stream object without Qdatastream but directly using the object

transfer towards pyside instead of pyqt6

2D plotting
    Generate mock-ups (done 5/31)
    Create functional systems based on mock ups
    3 plotting groups
       Group 1 - main plot group - Initially show fit with residuals and data as subplots (all with the same color scale)
           Clicking on one of the subplots swaps it with the primary plot
       Group 2 - multiple main plots with the same color scale bar
       Group 3 - multiple main plots with different scale bars
    Each plot/subplot could be moved/added to any other group and scale bars would automatically update
Drag-drop plots
    Drag any plot(s) into a plot subgroup 
    Visual feedback where the plot(s) would go (e.g. a template box would appear where the plot will go as the plot group is dragged)
Polydispertiy plots and where they should go
plan for next week:
 - continue with d&d (with no datastream, if possible)
 - start with 2D implementation based on the general mockup
 - dockable tabs for fitting
