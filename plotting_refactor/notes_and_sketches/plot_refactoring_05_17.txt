How can trends be combined with the plotting functionality?
Residuals displayed in another subplot on the bottom. - done
unique ID by timestamp - done, implmented with current time and fitpageindex as a sum



historical:
Plot refactoring was kicked off at code camp isis
concrete plans where there in jan 24 during the code camp

what is planned in other branches at the time:
generic data formats
views in addition to data formats
- data object lives in a view
- in addition: measurement time or detector distance are added to the view as metadata that are there for every measurement of this set

trends for packaging data:
- multiple datasets on the same instrument for different temeperatures or pressures for example


ideas for the demo:
tree like structure for data and plots (almost done)
Dataviewer owns plot widget for easier dataflow (done)
combobox instead of new window for sending to subplot (done)
