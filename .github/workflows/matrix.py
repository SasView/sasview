# Generate the matrix of jobs to run tests, build docs, build installers
#
# run `python .github/workflows/matrix.py --json` to see the output
#
# Philosophy:
# - test everything
# - get unittest results back as fast as possible, burning extra CPU time
#   to do that if necessary
# - sphinx is slow, build documentation separately to running the unittests
# - pyinstaller is slow, run it separately to running the unittests
