Quick Intro for Building Sasview
================================

Note - at the current time sasview will only run in gui form under Python 2.

Before trying to install and run sasview you'll need to check what
dependencies are required:

$ python check_packages.py

Many of these are available from PyPi, but some (e.g. h5py) may require more
involvement to build and install. If you use the conda package manager then
many of the pre-built dependencies are available there. This may be the easiest
route if you are on windows.

The build works in the pythonic way:

$ python setup.py build      # will build the package underneath 'build/'
$ python setup.py install    # will install the package into site-packages


If you want to check the build without installing:

$ python run.py              # will run the code in place (building the C code once, if required)

On OSX or windows you may need to use:

$ pythonw run.py


Build scripts that are used on http://build.sasview.org/ are in
build_tools. Make sure the build is run first obviously.

$ build_tools/jenkins_linux_build.sh
$ build_tools/jenkins_linux_test.sh
$ build_tools/jenkins_linux_pylint.sh

The scripts can be customized using environment variables, but 
should do a reasonable job as is in a sane setup.



To build just the Sphinx docs:
build_sphinx.py
