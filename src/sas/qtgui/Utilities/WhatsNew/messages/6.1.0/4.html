<h1>
    What's New: <i>Shape2SAS</i>
</h1>


<p><b>Shape2SAS allows the user to construct real space models from simple
      building blocks and generate the resulting SAS curve</b></p>

<p>Shape2SAS allows the user to construct arbitrary objects by combining shapes from a library in
    different orientations and positions.
    It includes tools for visualisation and calculation of small angle scattering results.
   </p>

<p><small>The current version is labelled "experimental" as it has not been thoroughly
   tested and still contains some known issues such as the aspect ratio of the
   real space visualization of the constructed object. We look forward to
   feedback from the community to improve this tool for the next release.</small></p>
