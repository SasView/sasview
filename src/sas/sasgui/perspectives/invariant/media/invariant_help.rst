Invariant Calculation
=====================

Principle
---------

In a multi-phase system, the integral of the appropriately dimensionally-\
weighted scattering cross-section (ie, 'intensity', $I(Q)$) is a *constant*
directly proportional to the mean-square average fluctuation in scattering
length density (SLD) and the phase composition but which, usefully, is
*independent* of the shape of the phase domains. If the scattering cross-\
section data are in absolute units this constant is known as the
*Scattering Invariant*, the *Porod Invariant*, or simply as the
*Invariant*, $Q^*$.

.. note::
   In this document we shall denote the invariant by the often encountered
   symbol $Q^*$. But the reader should be aware that other symbols can be
   encountered in the literature. Glatter & Kratky, and Stribeck, for example,
   both use $Q$, the same symbol we use to denote the scattering vector in
   SasView(!), whilst Melnichenko uses $Z$. Other variations include $Q_I$.

If the data is measured on an instrument with 'classic' pinhole geometry then

.. math::

    Q^* = \int_0^\infty Q^2I(Q)\,dQ

whereas if the data is measured on an instrument with slit geometry

.. math::

    Q^* = \Delta Q_v \int_0^\infty QI(Q)\,dQ

where $\Delta Q_v$ is the slit height and $Q$ denotes the scattering vector.

The worth of $Q^*$ is that it can be used to determine quantities such as the
volume fraction, composition, or specific surface area of a sample. It can also
be used to cross-calibrate different SAS instruments.

The difficulty with using $Q^*$  arises from the fact that experimental data is
never measured over the range $0 \le Q \le \infty$. At best, combining USAS and
WAS data might cover the range $10^{-5} \le Q \le 10$ $Ang^{-1}$ . Thus, it is
usually necessary to extrapolate the experimental data to both low and high
$Q$. For the

Low-\ $Q$ region (<= $Q_{min}$ in data):

*  The Guinier function $I_0.exp(-Q^2 R_g^2/3)$ can be used, where $I_0$
   and $R_g$ are obtained by fitting the data within the range $Q_{i}$ to
   $Q_{i+j}$ (where $i+j > i$) at the lowest $Q$-values. Alternatively a power
   law can be used. Because the integrals above are weighted by $Q^2$ or $Q$
   the low-$Q$ extrapolation only contributes a small proportion, say <3%,
   to the value of $Q^*$.
   
High-\ $Q$ region (>= $Q_{max}$ in data):

*  The power law function $C_p/Q^4$ is used where the constant
   $C_p$ is obtained by fitting the data within the range $Q_{n-m}$ to $Q_n$
   (where $n-m < n$) at the highest $Q$-values. This extrapolation typically
   contributes 3 - 20% of the value of $Q^*$ so having data measured to as
   large a value of $Q_{max}$ as possible is much more important.

Parameters
----------

For a two-phase system, the most commonly encountered situation, the Invariant
is 

.. math::

    Q^* = {2 \pi^2 (\Delta\rho)^2 \phi_1 \phi_2}
    
where $\Delta\rho = (\rho_1 - \rho_2)$ is the SLD contrast and $\phi_1$ and
$\phi_2$ are the volume fractions of the two phases ($\phi_1 + \phi_2 = 1$).
From this the volume fraction, specific surface area, and mean-square average
SLD fluctuation can be determined.

Volume Fraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. math::

    \phi_1 \phi_2 = \frac{Q^*}{2 \pi^2 (\Delta\rho)^2} \equiv A

and thus

.. math::

    \phi_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - 4A}}{2}

Specific Surface Area
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From Porod's Law

.. math::

    I(Q) = \frac{C_p}{Q^4}

where the *Porod Constant* is

.. math::

    C_p = 2 \pi (\Delta\rho)^2 S_v \equiv 2 \pi (\Delta\rho)^2 (S/V)

and $S_v$ is the specific surface area (the surface area-to-volume ratio,
$S/V$). From this it follows that

.. math::

    S_v = \frac{\pi \phi_1 \phi_2 C_p}{Q^*} \equiv \frac{\pi A C_p}{Q^*}

SLD Fluctuation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mean-square average of the SLD fluctuation is

.. math::

    \langle \eta^2 \rangle = \langle (\rho^*)^2 \rangle - \langle (\rho^*) \rangle^2

where

.. math::

    \langle (\rho^*)^2 \rangle = \phi_1 \rho_1^2 + \phi_2 \rho_2^2

.. math::
    
    \langle (\rho^*) \rangle = \phi_1 \rho_1 + \phi_2 \rho_2

Three-Phase Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the extension of Invariant Analysis to three phases, see the Melnichenko
reference, Chapter 6, Section 6.9.

Using invariant analysis
------------------------

1) Load some data with the *Data Explorer*.

   Select a dataset and use the *Send To* button on the *Data Explorer* to load
   the dataset into the *Invariant* panel. Or select *Invariant* from the
   *Analysis* category in the menu bar.
   
   A first estimate of $Q^*$ should be computed automatically. If not, click on
   the *Compute* button.

2) Use the *Customised Inputs* boxes on the *Invariant* panel to subtract
   any background, specify the contrast (i.e. difference in SLDs: note this
   must be specified for the eventual value of $Q^*$ to be on an absolute scale
   and to therefore have any meaning), or to rescale the data.

3) (Optional) If known, a value for $C_p$ can also be specified.

4) Adjust the extrapolation ranges and extrapolation types as necessary. In
   most cases the default values will suffice. Click the *Compute* button.

   To adjust the lower and/or higher $Q$ ranges, check the relevant *Enable
   Extrapolate* check boxes.

   If power law extrapolations are chosen, the exponent can be either held
   fixed or fitted. The number of points, $Npts$, to be used for the basis of
   the extrapolation can also be specified.

5) If the value of $Q^*$ calculated with the extrapolated regions is invalid, a
   red warning will appear at the top of the *Invariant* panel.

   The details of the calculation are available by clicking the *Details*
   button in the middle of the panel.
