        Different artists will have different kwargs.  See documentation
        on the contains() method for each artist.  One common properties
        are ind for the index of the item under the cursor, which is
        returned by Line2D and by collections.

        The following events are supported:
            enter: mouse cursor moves into the artist or to a new index
            leave: mouse cursor leaves the artist
            click: mouse button pressed on the artist

            release: mouse button released for the artist
            key: key pressed when mouse is on the artist
            keyrelease: key released for the artist

            name is the event name which was triggered
            artist is the object which triggered the event
            x,y are the screen coordinates of the mouse
            xdata,ydata are the graph coordinates of the mouse
            button is the mouse button being pressed/released
            key is the key being pressed/released
            shift,control,alt,meta are flags which are true if the
                corresponding key is pressed at the time of the event.
            details is a dictionary of artist specific details, such as the
                id(s) of the point that were clicked.

        When receiving an event, first check the modifier state to be
        sure it applies.  E.g., the callback for 'press' might be:
