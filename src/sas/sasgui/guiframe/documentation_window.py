"""
documentation module provides a simple means to add help throughout the
application. It checks for the existence of html2 package needed to support
fully html panel which supports css.  The class defined here takes a title for
the particular help panel, a pointer to the html documentation file of interest
within the documentation tree along with a 'command' string such as a page
anchor or a query string etc.  The path to the doc directory is retrieved
automatically by the class itself.  Thus with these three pieces of information
the class generates a panel with the appropriate title bar and help file
formatted according the style sheets called in the html file.  Finally, if an
old version of Python is running and the html2 package is not available the
class brings up the default browser and passes the file:/// string to it.  In
this case however the instruction portion is usually not passed for security
reasons.
