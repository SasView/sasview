Features
========

New in Version 5.0.6
--------------------
This is a point release which fixes a number of issues reported in earlier versions
of 5.0.x. Of particular note, the failure of the program to start when installing on
a new system due to issues finding the config file has been fixed. The speed with
which the program starts up has also been improved. The paracrystalline models, which
have been labelled as "under review" since 2018, have been checked and corrected (bcc
and fcc) and the documentation completely reworked (bcc, fcc, and sc).  Elsewhere,
plots now properly support custom data names in the legend, the LM optimizer failing
to run on GPUs or when the starting value of a parameter is outside the min/max range
has been fixed, a problem with the intermittent blanking of plots has also been fixed,
a number of defaults have been changed to be more reasonable, and a number of other
issues in the documentation have been corrected and/or updated.

This version of SasView is built with Sasmodels 1.0.7 and Bumps master.

New in Version 5.0.5
--------------------
This is a point release which fixes some issues reported in earlier versions
of 5.0.x. A few highlights are:

* The long standing issue with the Levenberg-Marquardt optimiser not respecting
  parameter bounds has been resolved by the move to a later version of
  the Bumps package.
* A bug which prevented the radius_effective parameter from being updated
  in $P(Q)*S(Q)$ models when the data were resolution smeared has been fixed.
* A bug that prevented the formation of composite mixture models with multiplicity
  (for example, models such as core_multi_shell*hardsphere + cylinder or
  core_multi_shell\@hardsphere + cylinder) has been fixed.
* The button to reset the selected Q-limits for fitting now works again!
* There has been a technical change to the point in the calculation at which the
  volume normalisation of $P(Q)*S(Q)$ models is applied by the move to a later
  version of the Sasmodels package. This change was actually incorporated into
  v5.0.4 but due to an oversight was omitted from the release notes at the time,
  although a note was added to the web version after the release (and has been
  subsequently added below). In most instances this change will go un-noticed
  unless you happen to be plotting the individual contributions of $P(Q)$ or
  $S(Q)$ and comparing them with similar calculations performed in versions of
  SasView before v5.0.4, at which point the scaling of the functions will be
  seen to be different.

There are also some **new features** in this version. Most notably:

* The Generic Scattering Calculator Tool has been overhauled and its
  capabilities significantly expanded. In particular, it will now perform
  magnetic/polarised SANS computations. As part of this upgrade, coordinate data
  in some VTK formats are now also supported.
* The data loaders have also been improved. SasView will now read CanSAS1D XML
  data files with multiple <SASdata> blocks in a single <SASentry>. And, by
  popular demand, 1D data can now be saved in CSV format. SESANS data files
  with the extension .sesans are now also recognised.
* A Boucher-type interfacial profile function has been added to the spherical_sld model.

This version of SasView is built with Sasmodels 1.0.6 and Bumps 0.9.0.

* https://github.com/SasView/sasmodels/compare/v1.0.5...v1.0.6

New Models
^^^^^^^^^^
The following models have been added to the `[Model Marketplace] <https://marketplace.sasview.org/>`_ since v5.0.4 was released:

* Magnetic Whirl
* Maier-Saupe distribution
* Cyclic Gaussian distribution
* Superball Model - Neither Sphere nor Cube
* OrientedMagneticChains

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ‘rpa’ (Random Phase Approximation, for polymer scattering) model has been
temporarily withdrawn. Some gremlins had crept into how the model parameters
interacted with the Fit Page which meant you were not performing the calculation
you thought you were. This is being investigated. Should you need it, a separate
binary blend model (the most performed calculation) is available from the
`[Model Marketplace] <https://marketplace.sasview.org/>`_ .

All the known bugs/feature requests can be found in the issues on github.
Note the sasmodels issues are now separate from the sasview issues (i.e. different repositories)

New in Version 5.0.4
--------------------
This is a point release which fixes some issues reported in earlier versions
of 5.0.x:

* A bug that had been around since 4.2.2 and which prevented Batch Fitting from
  using any dI values in the data file has finally been fixed. The consequence of
  this bug was that Single Fits and Batch Fits on the same datasets could return
  different parameters. Now, where present, dI values will always be used by default
  in both cases.
* The bug introduced in 5.0.3 which prevented the plotting of Batch Fit results has also
  been fixed.
* An issue with the behaviour of the 1D pinhole resolution smearing routine in cases of
  large divergence has been addressed.
* A number of improvements have been made to plotting and plot management.
* Several usability issues in the P(r) Inversion and Invariant Analysis perspectives
  have been addressed.
* Improvements have also been made to the functioning of Project Save/Load.

There are also some new features in this version:

* Though not strictly a new feature, the functionality and operation of parameter
  constraints has been significantly overhauled for this version.
* The slicer functionality has been significantly overhauled and made to work properly.
* The slider bars on plots for selecting the q-range for fitting that featured in earlier
  versions of SasView have been re-introduced by popular request, although they do not
  yet work on linearized plots.
* It is now possible to swap the dataset used to create an existing FitPage for a different
  dataset. This removes the need to re-generate a complex model (eg, featuring many parameters
  and/or constraints) many times over to use it to fit several datasets.
* It is now also possible to assign custom names to loaded datasets, rather than just
  identifying the data by its filename. Right-click on a dataset in the Data Explorer
  to activate.

There has also been a technical change in this version to how the volume
normalisation is incorporated in the interaction calculator that computes $I(Q)$
from $P(Q) S(Q)$. The change was made in Sasmodels 1.0.5 with which this version
is built and will affect all future versions of SasView. Prior to the change
the scaling of the $P(Q)$ function that might appear in the *Data Explorer* was
incorrect. This was easily seen if $P(Q)$ and $I(Q)$ were plotted together but
had apparently escaped notice for some time. But this does, of course, mean that 
comparisons of the $P(Q)$ contributions to models between this version of SasView
and previous versions will differ. Further details of the change can be found
`here <https://github.com/SasView/sasview/issues/1698>`_.

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
It has come to our attention that some Mac users get a dialogue box
saying *“SasView5.app”* is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move
it to the Trash when they try and install 5.0.4. This seems to affect
machines running MacOS earlier than 10.15. However, we have found that
it is possible to install SasView on 10.13, for example, by clearing
the extended attributes on the package by executing the command:
xattr -cr /Applications/SasView5.app

At this time, the reinstated slider bars on plots for selecting the
q-range for fitting do not work on linearized plots.

The button for resetting the Q-range for fitting to the data limits
(FitPage > Fit Options > Fitting Range) is also not working.

All the known bugs/feature requests can be found in the issues on github.
Note the sasmodels issues are now separate from the sasview issues (i.e. different repositories)

New in Version 5.0.3
--------------------
This is a point release which fixes several issues, but in particular:

* a serious bug in the resolution smearing interface which was applying
  a single value of $dq/q$ to all data points even if $dq/q$ was provided in
  the data file;
* a very long-standing bug in the Invariant Analysis interface which was
  computing specific surface ($Sv$) values that were *twice* what they should
  have been (The opportunity has also been taken to completely overhaul the
  documentation for the Invariant Analysis at the same time);
* inconsistent and incorrect behaviour of the 'is fittable' checkbox
  for polydispersities which could lead to unrealistic PD values being
  returned during fitting.

New features/improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* sasview # 1622: RC1 problems with installation/running on Windows
* sasview # 1565: (ESS_GUI) Report dialog enhancements
* sasview # 1564: Enhancements to Report Results
* sasview # 1552: Enable mpl toolbar
  
There are also several usability improvements, including better handling of
constraints between datasets for simultaneous fits, and control over plots.

With this release Windows users are no longer guided to install SasView
to C:\Program Files. This had started to become an issue as some IT providers
tightened their security settings, particularly under Windows 10, either
causing installation to fail (unless the user could elevate permissions), or
prevent SasView starting ('failed to execute script sasview'). The installation
process now prompts for the type of installation required, and defaults to
C:\SasView-x.x.x

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
At this time, and unlike version 4.x, only fitting and P(r) inversion sessions can be saved as project files.

There is also a bug which is stopping Batch Fitting from using the intensity uncertainty (dI) data if this 
is present in the files being processed. As the default behaviour of normal Single Fitting is to automatically 
use the dI data in the file if it is present, this means that the results of Single Fitting and Batch Fitting 
the same data will differ.

All the known bugs/feature requests can be found in the issues on github.

New in Version 5.0.2
--------------------
This is a point release which fixes several issues reported in version 5.0.1, however
there are also some new features:

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
A very long-standing error has been identified in the Invariant Analysis
perspective. The value of the specific surface $Sv$ that is being returned
is in fact *twice* the value that it should be. Work is underway to correct this
and some other deficiencies in the operation of the perspective, and to significantly
enhance the invariant documentation.

Also, at this time, and unlike version 4.x, only fitting sessions can be saved as project files.


New in Version 5.0.1
--------------------
This is a point release which fixes several issues reported in version 5.0.0.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixes sasview # 1452: Clarified issue with Add/Multiply operation for plugin models

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
A problem has been identified in Version 4.2.2 which also affects versions
5.0.0 and 5.0.1. The Easy Add/Multiply Editor dialog should not be used to
combine a plugin model with a built-in model, or to combine two plugin models.
In 5.0.0 the operation will fail (generating an error message in the Log Explorer).
Whilst in 5.0.1 the operation has been blocked until the problem can be fixed.
If it is necessary to generate a plugin model from more than two built-in models,
please edit the plugin model .py file directly and specify the combination of built-in
models directly. For example::

     from sasmodels.core import load_model_info
     from sasmodels.sasview_model import make_model_from_info
     model_info = load_model_info('power_law + fractal + gaussian_peak + gaussian_peak')
     model_info.name = 'MyBigPluginModel'
     model_info.description = 'For fitting pores in crystalline framework'
     Model = make_model_from_info(model_info)


New in Version 5.0
------------------
This is a new version of SasView featuring new and enhanced GUI, back-end calculations,
GUI separation, optimization of calculations and other improvements. This release also
includes beta (decoupling) approximation for intensity calculation.

The release is based on Python 3 and Qt5/PyQt5.

We recommend that you avoid using installation folder paths which contain spaces, non-Latin
characters or characters not available on a standard keyboard.

Changes/Improvements from 5.0.beta2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Beta (decoupling) approximation has been introduced
* Stop fit button added to Constrained and Simultaneous Fitting
* Plotting has been improved
* Volume fraction naming conflicts has been resolved
* SLD calculator user interface has been improved
* Fit Options tab has been improved
* Windows installer path specification has been resolved
* Copy parameters function has been fixed
* Save/Load Project functionality has been improved

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Documentation for Constrained and Simultaneous Fitting has been considerably reworked.
* Tutorials have been adapted to match 5.0 interface

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
All the known bugs/feature requests can be found in the issues on github.

`[sasmodels] <https://github.com/SasView/sasmodels/milestones>`_


New in Version 4.2.0
--------------------
This release heralds many improvements and a host of bug fixes, along with
some significant changes from previous versions. Further, as promised, it
marks the end of support for 32 bit operating systems and is only
available for 64 bit operating systems.

With this version the change to the new model API and plugins infrastructure
begun with 4.0 is essentially complete (though extensions are in the works,
and more are likely, they should remain backwardly compatible with previous
versions of SasView).

.. warning:: Old-style plugin models, including old sum|multiply models, continue
             to be supported (i.e. SasView will run them) in 4.x, although our
             automatic on-the-fly translation may not cope in all use cases (see 
             Known Issues below). However, this backward compatibility will be 
             removed in 5.0 and users are therefore strongly encouraged to 
             convert their custom models to the new API.

Finally, the changes to orientation angles and orientational distribution
definitions are now also complete.

Changes
^^^^^^^
* The infrastucture for calculating 2D patterns from 3D orientated objects
  has been totally re-factored. It is now more accurate and consistent
  across models.
* The way that SasView defines the orientation of anisometric and
  aligned objects has been completely overhauled. It now differs from
  previous versions.
* Plugin models, including sum|multiply models, have completely migrated
  to the new infrastructure. NOTE that 3.x type models as well as early,
  intermediate 4.x type models, including those generated by sum|multiply
  will continue to be supported in 4.x but will likely no longer be
  supported after the move to 5.0.  Users are strongly encouraged to
  migrate any custom models.
* The NeXus loader has been removed as it is superseded by the NXcanSAS
  standard loader and SasView does not support the treatment of raw
  data.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The accuracy/speed of some numerical integrations have been improved.
* An orientation viewer tool has been introduced to assist in
  understanding the new orientation framework.
* Problems with the computation of magnetic scattering from some
  objects have been rectified. Some questions remain however.
* The known issue with the core_shell_parallelepiped model is now fixed.
* An error in the be_polyelectrolyte model was identified and rectified, but 
  the fix is yet to be validated.
* (Added post-release) An error with the reporting of the scale parameter 
  from the spinodal model was rectified.
* A number of issues and inconsistencies with the creation of
  sum|multiply models have been rectified.
* A Boltzmann distribution has been added for polydispersity/orientational
  distributions.
* Some batch slicing options have been introduced.
* Correlation function analysis now computes both the 1D and 3D functions.
* There are several data loading improvements.
* There are several improvements to Save/Load Project.
* The SasView version number now appears in Reports.
* The Release Notes are now available from the program Help menu.
* There have been numerous other bug fixes.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Several sections of the help documentation have undergone significant
checking and updating, particularly those relating to orientation,
magnetic scattering, and polydispersity distributions.

Detailed advanced instructions for plugin writing and some scripting
instructions have also been added.

Concerns about the intended versus implemented meaning of some parameters
in the bcc_paracrystal, fcc_paracrystal, and sc_paracrystal models have
been brought to our attention. These have yet to be resolved and so a
Warning has been placed on each of these models. Anyone who feels they
may have the requisite expertise to investigate these concerns is strongly
encouraged to contact the Developers!

Other Work
^^^^^^^^^^
* A Third-Party initiative has recently succeeded in getting SasView to
  run on Debian. More details at
  https://github.com/SasView/sasview/wiki/DevNotes_Projects_Debian
* With this release we have started to prepare for the inevitable move
  to Python 3, which will occur with the release of 5.0
* SasView 5.0 is currently in development. The two most significant
  features of this version will be (i) a move away from the present
  WxPython GUIs to new, completely rewritten, Qt5 GUIs, and
  (ii)implementation of the Beta-approximation for S(Q). Subject to
  resources, some limited access to the latter functionality may be
  available in a future SasView 4.x release.

New in Version 4.1.0
--------------------
This incremental release brings a series of new features and improvements,
and a host of bug fixes. Of particular note are:

Correlation Function Analysis (Corfunc)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This performs a correlation function analysis of one-dimensional SAXS/SANS data,
or generates a model-independent volume fraction profile from the SANS from an
adsorbed polymer/surfactant layer.

A correlation function may be interpreted in terms of an imaginary rod moving
through the structure of the material. G1(R) is the probability that a rod of
length R moving through the material has equal electron/neutron scattering
length density at either end. Hence a frequently occurring spacing within a
structure manifests itself as a peak.

A volume fraction profile \Phi(z) describes how the density of polymer
segments/surfactant molecules varies with distance from an (assumed locally flat)
interface. *This is not yet implemented*.

Fitting of SESANS Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Data from Spin-Echo SANS measurements can now be loaded and fitted. The data will
be plotted against the correct axes and models will automatically perform a Hankel
transform in order to calculate SESANS from a SANS model.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The documentation has undergone significant checking and updating.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Correlation function (corfunc) analysis of 1D SAS data added from CCP13
* File converter tool for multi-file single column data sets
* SESANS data loading and direct fitting using the Hankel transformation
* Saving and loading of simultaneous and constrained fits now supported
* Save states from SasView v3.x.y now loaded using sasmodel model names
* Saving and loading of projects with 2D fits now supported
* Loading a project removes all existing data, fits, and plots
* Structure factor and form factor can be plotted independently
* OpenCL is disabled by default and can be enabled through a fit menu
* Data and theory fields are now independently expandable

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixes #667: Models computed multiple times on parameters changes

  simultaneous/constrained fitting panel
* Fixes #474: resulting from changes in 3.1.1 that had
  introduced an error in the high-Q of slit-smeared models.
* Fixes #478: which would cause wx to run out of IDs and result
  in SasView crashing even if left alone.
* Fixes #479: missing help button on simultaneous/constrained fit page
* Fixes #480: GUI resizing issues on simultaneous fit page
* Fixes #486: broken Report Results
* Fixes #488: redraw issues in fit page


New in Version 3.1.1
--------------------
Fixes #457 that prevented SasView from starting if the user was not
connected to the internet, or was behind a proxy server.


New in Version 3.1.0
--------------------
The documentation/help has had a complete overhaul including:

* A completely new presentation interface (Sphinx).
* Proof reading!
* Updating for latest features.
* A Help (or sometimes ?) button has been added to every panel, and some
  sub panels if appropriate, linking to the appropriate section in the
  documentation.
* The model help has been split so that the Details button now brings up
  a very short pop-up giving the equation being used while HELP goes to
  the section in the full documentation describing the model.
* Extensive help has also been added for the new optimizer engine (see
  below) including rules of thumb on how and when to choose a given
  optimizer and what the parameters do.

The optimizer engine has been completely replaced. The new optimizer
still defaults to the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. However 4
other optimizers are now also available. Each starts with a set of default
parameters which can be tuned. The DREAM optimizer takes the longest but
is the most powerful and yields rich information including full parameter
correlation and uncertainty plots. A results panel has been added to
accommodate this. The five new optimizers are:

* A Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer
* A Quasi-Newton BFGS optimizer
* A Nelder-Mead Simplex optimizer
* A Differential Evolution optimizer
* A Monte Carlo optimizer (DREAM)

New models were added:

* MicelleSphCoreModel (currently residing in the Uncategorized category)

Existing models were updated:

* LamellarPS (bug in polydispersity integration fixed)
* RectangularPrismModel
* RectangularHollowPrismModel
* RectangularHollowPrismInfThinWallsModel

Other work:

* Infrastructure to allow SESANS data to be fit with models was added. This
  will become available in a future release but can currently be used from
  the command line with some caveats.
* A number of bugs were fixed including a thread crashing issue and an
  incorrect slit smearing resolution calculation.
* Implemented much more robust error logging to enable much easier
  debugging in general but particularly the debugging of issues reported by
  SasView users.
* A number of infrastructure tasks under the hood to enhance maintainability
* Upgrade from Wx 2.8 to Wx 3.0.2 which allows several new features but
  required significant additional rework as well.
* Fully implemented Sphinx to the build process to produce both better
  user documentation and developer documentation.
* Restructuring of the code base to more unified nomenclature and structure
  so that the source installation tree more closely matches the installer
  version tree.
* Code cleanup (an ongoing task).
* Migration of the repository to github simplifying contributions from
  non-project personnel through pull requests.


New in Version 3.0.0
--------------------
* The GUI look and feel has been refactored to be more familiar for
  Windows users by using MDI frames. Graph windows are also now free-
  floating.
* Five new models have been added: PringlesModel, CoreShellEllipsoidXTModel,
  RectangularPrismModel, RectangularHollowPrismModel and
  RectangularHollowPrismInfThinWallsModel.
* The data loader now supports ILL DAT data files and reads the full meta
  information from canSAS file formats.
* Redefined convention for specifying angular parameters for anisotropic
  models.
* A number of minor features have been added such as permitting a log
  distribution of points when using a model to simulate data, and the
  addition of a Kratky plot option to the linear plots.
* A number of bugs have also been fixed.
* Save Project and Save Analysis now work more reliably.
* BETA: Magnetic contrast supporting full polarization analysis has been
  implemented for some spherical and cylindrical models.
* BETA: Two new tools have been added:

  * A generic scattering calculator which takes an atomic, magnetic or
    SLD distribution in space and generates the appropriate 2D
    scattering pattern. In some cases the orientationally averaged
    (powder) 1D scattering can also be computed. Supported formats
    include: SLD or text, PDB, and OMF magnetic moment distribution
    file.
  * An image viewer/converter for data in image format; this reads in
    an image file and will attempt to convert the image pixels to
    data. Supported formats include: TIFF, TIF, PNG, BMP, JPG.


New in Version 2.2.1
--------------------
* Minor patch to support CanSAS XML v1.1 file format
* Added DataInfo for data in the DataExplorer and plots
* Added Maximize/Restore button in the title bar of the graphs
* Added a hide button in the toolbar of the graph panel

Feature set from previous versions
-----------------------------------
Perspectives Available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Invariant calculator: Calculates the invariant, volume fraction, and
  specific surface area.
* P(r) inversion calculator: Indirect Fourier transformation method.
* Fitting: the tool used for modeling and fitting 1D and 2D data to
  analytical model functions
* Tools: provides a number of useful supplementary tools such as SLD
  calculation

Fitting
^^^^^^^
* Includes a large number of model functions, both form factors and structure factors.
* Support P(Q)*S(Q) for form factors that flag they can be so multiplied.
* Supports Gaussian, lognormal, Shulz, rectangular and custom distribution
  functions for models that need to include polydispersity or for orientational
  distributions if appropriate.
* Anisotropic shapes and magnetic moment modeling in 2D allow for a non-uniform
  distribution of orientations of a given axis leading to modeling and fitting
  capabilities of non azimuthaly symmetric data.
* User can choose to weight fits or not. If using weights, the user can choose
  the error bar on each point if provided in the file, the square root
  of the intensity or the intensity itself.
* Instrumental resolution smearing of model or fits is provided with several
  options: read the resolution/point fromt he file. Input a pinhole resolution
  or a slit resolution.
* Users can define the Qrange (Qmin and Qmax) for both 1D and 2D data for
  fitting and modeling, but not graphically.  The range can be reset to the
  defaults (limits of q in data set for a fit) with the reset button.
* A mask can be applied to 2D calculation and fitting.
* Normalized residual plots are provided with every fit.
* Model function help available through detail button or from the fitting panel.
* Simultaneous/(advanced)constrained fitting allows for fitting a single
  data set or several different sets simultaneously with the application
  of advanced constraints relating fit parameters to functions of other
  parameters (including from a different set). For example thickness of
  shell = sin(30) times the length.
* Models that are the sum of two other models can be easily generated through the
  SUM Model menubar item.
* New Python models can be added on the fly by creating an appropriate Python
  file in the model plugin directory. Two tools are provided to help:
  An easy to use custom model editor allows the quick generation of new Python
  models by supplying only the parameters and their default value (box 1)
  and the mathematical function of the model (box 2) and generating the
  necessary .py file.  A separate advanced model editor provides a full Python
  file editor.  Either way once saved the model becomes immediately available
  to the application.
* A batch fitting capability allows for the analysis of a series of data sets to
  a single model and provides the results in a tabular form suitable for saving
  or plotting the evolution of the fit parameters with error bars (from within
  the application).

Tools
^^^^^
* A scattering length density calculator,including some X-ray information
  is provided.
* A density to vol. fraction converter is provided
* In application access to a Python shell/editor (PyCrust) is provided
* An instrument resolution calculator, including possible gravitational and
  TOF effects is provided

  adjusted.
* Supports output of plot to a variety of graphic formats. Supported formats
  include: png, eps, emf, jpg/jpeg, pdf, ps, tif/tiff, rawRGBbitmap(raw, rgba),
  and scalable vector graphic (svg/svgz)
* Supports ouput of data in plot (1 or 2D) to limited data formats
* Multiple data sets can be loaded into a single graph for viewing (but a fit
  plot can currently only have a single plot).
* Extensive context sensitive plot/fitting/manipulation options are available
  through a right mouse click pop-up menu on plots.

Data management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Supports 2 + column 1D ASCII data, NIST 1D and 2D data, and canSAS data
  via plug-in mechanism which can easily allow other readers as appropriate.
* 2D data is expected in Q space but for historical reasons accepts the
  NIST 2D raw pixel format and will do conversion internally.
* The full data and metadata available to SasView is viewable in ASCII via
  right clicking on a data set and choosing Data Info in the DataExplorer
  or on the plots
* Supports loading a single file, multiple files, or a whole folder
* An optional Data Explorer is provided (default) which simplifies managing,
  plotting, deleting, or setup for computation. Most functions however do
  not require access to the explorer/manager and can be accessed through
  right click menus and the toolbar.  The data explorer can be re-started
  from the menu bar.

Data manipulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Support various 2D averaging methods : Circular, sectors, annular,
  boxsum, boxQx and boxQy.

  the command line.
* Limited bookmarking capability to later recall the results of a fit calculation
  is provided.
* Extensive help is provided through context sensitive mouse roll-over,
  information bar (at the bottom of the panel), the console menu, and
  access to the help files in several different ways.


Downloading and Installing
==========================

.. note:: If you have a SasView installer (.EXE or .MSI), you do not need to
          worry about any of the following.  However, it is highly recommended 
          that any previous versions of SasView are uninstalled prior to 
          installing the new version UNLESS you are installing SasView to 
          versioned folders.

The easiest approach to setting up the proper environment to build from source 
is to use Conda. Instructions for setting up and using Conda can be found at 
https://github.com/SasView/sasview/wiki/DevNotes_DevEnviroment
                    
Additional information is available at http://www.sasview.org/download/ under 
the 'For Developers' section, and on our Trac site at https://github.com/SasView/sasview/wiki/

System Requirements
-------------------
* For SasView 4.x and earlier: A Python version >= 2.5 and < 3.0 should be running 
  on the system. We currently use Python 2.7
* For SasView 5.x: A Python version > 3.0 should be running on the system. We 
  currently use Python 3.6

Package Dependencies
--------------------
* Ensure the required dependencies are installed
* For the latest list of dependencies see the appropriate yml file in
  the SasView repo at sasview/build_tools/conda/ymls

Installing from Source
----------------------
* Get the source code
* Create a folder to contain the source code; if working with
  multiple versions you might want to use versioned folder names
  like 'sasview-x.x.x'
* Open a command line window in the source code folder
* To get the CURRENT DEVELOPMENT VERSION from source control use
  git clone https://github.com/SasView/sasview.git sasview
  git clone https://github.com/Sasview/sasmodels.git sasmodels
  git clone https://github.com/bumps/bumps.git bumps
* To get a SPECIFIC RELEASE VERSION from source control go to
  https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases
  and download the required zip or tar.gz file. Unzip/untar it
  to the source code folder.

Building and Installing
-----------------------
* To build the code
  use 'python setup.py build'
* To build the documentation
  use'python setup.py docs'

Running SasView
---------------
* use 'python run.py'; this runs from the source directories, so you
  don't have to rebuild every time you make a change, unless you are
  changing the C model files.
* if using Conda the above command will also build SasView, but you 
  must issue 'activate sasview' first.

Known Issues
============

A full list of known bugs and feature requests by release version that 
users may wish to be aware of can be viewed at the following links:

`[sasview] <https://github.com/SasView/sasview/milestones>`_

`[sasmodels] <https://github.com/SasView/sasmodels/milestones>`_

All 5.0.x versions / 4.2.2 - All systems
----------------------------------------
A problem has been identified in Version 4.2.2 which also affects all 5.0.x
versions. The Easy Add/Multiply Editor dialog should not be used to combine
a plugin model with a built-in model, or to combine two plugin models. In
5.0.x the operation will fail, generating an error message in the Log Explorer
similar to

     ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plugin_module_name'

If it is necessary to generate a plugin model from more than two built-in models,
please edit the plugin model .py file directly and specify the combination of
built-in models directly. For example::

     from sasmodels.core import load_model_info
     from sasmodels.sasview_model import make_model_from_info
     model_info = load_model_info('power_law + fractal + gaussian_peak + gaussian_peak')
     model_info.name = 'MyBigPluginModel'
     model_info.description = 'For fitting pores in crystalline framework'
     Model = make_model_from_info(model_info)
     
5.0.0 / 5.0.1 / 5.0.2 / 5.0.3 - All systems
-------------------------------------------
There is a bug which is stopping Batch Fitting from using the intensity 
uncertainty (dI) data if this is present in the files being processed. 
As the default behaviour of normal Single Fitting is to automatically 
use the dI data in the file if it is present, this means that the results 
of Single Fitting and Batch Fitting the same data will differ.

All versions upto and including 5.0.2 - All systems
---------------------------------------------------
A very long-standing error has been identified in the Invariant Analysis
perspective. The value of the specific surface $Sv$ that is being returned
is in fact *twice* the value that it should be.
     
5.0.0 / 5.0.1 / 5.0.2 - All systems
-----------------------------------
In these versions, and unlike version 4.x, only fitting sessions can be saved as project files.

4.2.0 - All systems
-------------------
The refactoring of the plugin model architecture means that some issues 
may be encountered if Save Project/Analysis files using plugin models 
created in earlier versions of SasView are loaded in version 4.2.0.

For example:

* on loading an old project file an error window appears with the error 
  *This model state has missing or outdated information* or *dictionary changed size during iteration*.

   * if this occurs, try restarting SasView and reloading the project.
   
* on loading an old project file all the FitPages and Graphs appear, but 
  only the SasView default model parameters appear in the FitPages.

  * this has happened because plugin model parameter names have changed. 
    There are two possible workarounds:
    
   * Install the version of SasView that the project was created in, 
     recreate the plugin in that version, then run 4.2.0 and re-load 
     the project. All being well, 4.2.0 will still compile the old 
     plugin.

   * If 4.2.0 cannot compile the old plugin, the more tedious solution 
     is to use a text editor to do global search & replace operations 
     to change all the parameter names in the project file by hand. The 
     quickest way to see the *existing* parameter names is simply to 
     scroll to the bottom of the project file. To see what the *new* 
     parameter names should be, simply create the equivalent plugin in 
     SasView 4.2.0. In most instances, what was *p1_parameter* will 
     become *A_parameter*, *p2_parameter* will become *B_parameter*, 
     and so on. 

4.1.x- All systems
------------------
The conversion to sasmodels infrastructure is ongoing and should be
completed in the next release. In the meantime this leads to a few known
issues:

* The way that orientation is defined is being refactored to address
  long standing issues and comments.  In release 4.1 however only models
  with symmetry (e.g. a=b) have been converted to the new definitions.
  The rest (a <> b <> c - e.g. parellelepiped) maintain the same
  definition as before and will be converted in 4.2.  Note that
  orientational distribution also makes much more sense in the new
  framework.  The documentation should indicate which definition is being
  used for a given model.
* The infrastructure currently handles internal conversion of old style
  models so that user created models in previous versions should continue
  to work for now. At some point in the future such support will go away.
  Everyone is encouraged to convert to the new structure which should be
  relatively straight forward and provides a number of benefits.
* In that vein, the distributed models and those generated by the new
  plugin model editor are in the new format, however those generated by
  sum|multiply models are the old style sum|multiply models. This should
  also disappear in the near future
* The on the fly discovery of plugin models and changes thereto behave
  inconsistently.  If a change to a plugin model does not seem to
  register, the Load Plugin Models (under fitting -> Plugin Model
  Operations) can be used.  However, after calling Load Plugin Models, the
  active plugin will no longer be loaded (even though the GUI looks like
  it is) unless it is a sum|multiply model which works properly.  All
  others will need to be recalled from the model dropdown menu to reload
  the model into the calculation engine.  While it might be annoying it
  does not appear to prevent SasView from working..
* The model code and documentation review is ongoing. At this time the
  core shell parellelepiped is known to have the C shell effectively fixed
  at 0 (noted in documentation) while the triaxial ellipsoid does not seem
  to reproduce the limit of the oblate or prolate ellipsoid. If errors are
  found and corrected, corrected versions will be uploaded to the
  marketplace.
* (Added after Release 4.2.0) The scale parameter reported from the spinodal 
  model is the square root of the true value.

3.1- All systems
----------------
* The documentation window may take a few seconds to load the first time
  it is called. Also, an internet connection is required before
  equations will render properly. Until then they will show in their
  original TeX format.
* If the documentation window remains stubbornly blank, try installing a
  different browser and set that as your default browser. Issues have
  been noted with Internet Explorer 11.
* Check for Updates may fail (with the status bar message ' Cannot
  connect to the application server') if your internet connection uses
  a proxy server. Tested resolutions for this are described on the
  website FAQ.
* The copy and paste functions (^C, ^V) in the batch mode results grid
  require two clicks: one to select the cell and a second to select the
  contents of the cell.
* The tutorial has not yet been updated and is somewhat out of date
* Very old computers may struggle to run the 3.x and later releases
* Polydispersity on multiple parameters included in a simultaneous/
  constrained fit will likely not be correct
* Constrained/simultaneous fit page does not have a stop button
* Constrained/simultaneous fit do not accept min/max limits
* Save project does not store the state of all the windows
* Loading projects can be very slow
* Save Project only works once a data set has been associated with
  a model.  Error is reported on status bar.
* There is a numerical precision problem with the multishell model when
  the inner radius gets large enough (ticket #288)
* The angular distribution angles are not clearly defined and may in
  some cases lead to incorrect calculations(ticket #332)

3.1 - Windows
-------------
* If installed to same directory as old version without first removing
  the old version, the old desktop icon will remain but point to the
  new exe version. Likewise all the start menu folders and items will
  have the old name even though pointing to the new version.  Usually
  safest to uninstall old version prior to installing new version anyway.

3.1 - MAC
---------
* Application normally starts up hidden. Click icon in Dock to view/use
  application.
* Multiprocessing does not currently work on MAC OS

3.1 - Linux
-----------
* Not well tested
