Menu Bar
========
The menu bar at the top of the *SasView* window gives you access to additional features of the program:

File
----
The File option allows you load data into *SasView* for analysis, or to save the work you have been doing.

Data can be loaded one file at a time, or by selecting multiple files, or by loading an entire folder of 
files (in which case *SasView* will attempt to make an intelligent guess as to what to load based on the 
file formats it recognises in the folder!).

A *SasView* session can also be saved and reloaded as an 'Analysis' (an individual model fit or invariant 
calculation, etc), or as a 'Project' (everything you have done since starting your *SasView* session).

Edit
----
The Edit option allows you to:

- undo/redo your recent changes;
- copy and paste parameters between *SasView* analysis windows;
- copy parameters from a *SasView* analysis window to the Clipboard as either tab-delimited text (compatible with Microsoft Excel) or LaTex-wrapped text;
- generate a summary 'Report' of the most recent analysis performed;
- reset parameter values in the P(r) Inversion analysis page.

View
----
The View option allows you to:

- show the Batch Fitting Results Panel if it has been closed;
- show/hide the Data Explorer Panel;
- show/hide the Toolbar of icons below the Menu Bar;
- select the default location that *SasView* looks in for data to analyse (the *SasView* installation directory, the initial default, or a custom folder). NB: any change only takes effect when *SasView* is restarted;
- change the default assignment of categories (*Shapes*\, *Shape-independent*\, *Structure Factor*\) for fitting model functions.

Tools
-----
The Tools option provides access to a comprehensive range of tools and utilities. See :ref:`tools` for more information.

Window
------
The Window option allows you to select which *SasView* windows are visible.  

Analysis
--------
The Analysis option provides access to the key functionality of *SasView*:

- Model Fitting;
- P(r) Inversion;
- Invariant Analysis;
- Correlation Function Analysis (*SasView* 4.1 and later)

See :ref:`analysis` for more information.

Fitting
-------
The Fitting option allows you to:

- create a new FitPage;
- change optimiser (under Fit Options);
- view fit parameter correlations, distributions, and convergence traces (under Fit Results);
- create/edit a Plugin Model.

Additional functionality is available under this menu option during particular types of model fitting, including:

- setting up a Constrained or Simultaneous Fit;
- combining a Batch Fit (an obscure capability);
- setting up Chain Fitting.

Help
----
The Help option provides access to:

- this help documentation;
- a :ref:`tutorial` on using *SasView* (in pdf format);
- information on how to acknowledge *SasView* in publications;
- information about the version of *SasView* you are using;
- the :ref:`marketplace`\ ;
- a check to see if there is a more recent version of *SasView*.
