This tool is to load image files (in the format of png, bmp, gif, jpg, or tif) 
and to display it in the x-y coordinate (against the pixel number). The displayed plot then
 can be saved, printed, and copied. 
 The plot can also be resized by dragging the corner of the panel.

5. If the image is taken from a 2D detector, it can be converted to our 2D data where 
the z values are computed by the Eq. z = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B unless the picture file
is formatted in an 8 bit Grey-Scale tif. In the "Convert to Data" dialog, users set 
the proper values in the text boxes and then click the OK button to close and to send the data generated to the Data
 Explorer in the SasView main window. The "Cancel" button will just close the dialog 
 (See Picture below).
