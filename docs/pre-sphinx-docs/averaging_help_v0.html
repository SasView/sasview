<h5><a name="Description">Description</a></h5>
<p>
 This feature allows you to perform different types of averages on your data,
 and allows you to see what regions of the detector will contribute to 
 the average. 
 The region to be averaged will be drown and can be modified by dragging the lines around. 
</p>


<h5><a name="How to use">How to Average?</a></h5>
<p>
Right click on 2D data for the context menu to appear. Select one type of averages
among <b>"sector [Q view]", "Annulus [Phi view]", "Box sum", "Box averaging in Qx ",
"box averaging on Qy","Perform circular Average".</b>
</p> 
<p>
A slicer will appear except for <b> "Perform circular Average"</b>
that you can drag by clicking on a slicer 's marker. 
 When the marker is highlighted in red , it means that the slicer can change size.You can
 also move some of the slicer by simply drag its side when highlighted in red.
 the slicer size will be reset to its previous size if the user try to select a region greater 
 than the size of the data.
 
</p>
 <p>The user can also select a region to average when a slicer has been selected already by <b>right 
 clicking </b> on the context menu and selecting <b>Edit Slicer Parameters</b>. The dialog window 
 will appears and the user can enter values to selected a region or selected numbers of points to 
 plot <b>nbins</b>.
</p>
 
<p>
 For <b>Box sum</b> , when the user selects this option, a new panel is created containing 
 the result of average of the sum of every pixels contains on  that data.The user can also enter 
 values to select a region.
</p>

<h5><a name="Circular Average">Perform Circular Average</a></h5>
<p>
It will perform and average in constant q-rings around the (x,y)
 pixel location of the beam center. 
</p>


<h5><a name="Masked Average">Masked Circular Average</a></h5>
<p>
This operation is same as 'Perform Circular Average' except that the masked region is excluded if masked.
</p>

<h5><a name="Sector">Sector [Q view]</a></h5>
<p>
It averages in constant q-arcs. The width of the sector
 is specified in degrees (+/- delta phi) each direction from the central angle (phi).
</p>

<h5><a name="Annulus"> Annulus [Phi view]</a></h5>
<p>
It performs an average between two q-values centered in (0,0),
 and averaged over a width of a specified number of pixels.
 The data is returned as a function of angle (phi) in degrees. 
 Moving one circle of this slicer
 to radius of zero corresponding to a circular averaging on radius qmax , 
 the outer circle.
  The angle zero starts from the positive x-axis direction.
</p>

<h5><a name="Box sum"> Box sum</a></h5>
<p>
Perform the sum of counts in a 2D region of interest.When editing the slicer ,the user can 
enter the length and the width the rectangle slicer and the coordinates of the center of this
rectangle. 
</p>
<h5><a name="Box averaging in Qx"> Box averaging in Qx</a></h5>
<p>
Computes average I(Qx) for a region of interest. When editing the slicer ,the user can 
control the length and the width the rectangle slicer. 
The averaged output is calculated from the constant bins with rectangular shape.
The resultant q values are nominal values, i.e., the central values of each bins on the x-axis.

</p>
<h5><a name="Box averaging in Qy"> Box averaging in Qy</a></h5>
<p>
 Computes average I(Qy) for a region of interest.When editing the slicer ,the user can 
control the length and the width the rectangle slicer. 
The averaged output is calculated from the constant bins with rectangular shape.
The resultant q values are nominal values, i.e., the central values of each bins on the y-axis.
