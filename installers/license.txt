This software was originally developed by the University of Tennessee 
as part of the Distributed Data Analysis of Neutron Scattering 
Experiments (DANSE) project funded by the US National Science Foundation
and is currently being developed as an open source project hosted on GitHub
and managed by a consortium of scattering facilities.

Participating facilities include: the University of Tennessee, the University 
of Maryland, the European Spallation Source, the National Institute of 
Standards & Technology Center for Neutron Research, the Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory Neutron Sciences Directorate, the ISIS Neutron & Muon Source, the 
Institut Laue Langevin, the Diamond Light Source, and Delft University of 
Technology.
