    - New in Version 4.1.0
      ------------------
      This incremental release brings a series of new features and improvements,
      and a host of bug fixes. Of particular note are:
      
      - Correlation Function Analysis (Corfunc)
      	This performs a correlation function analysis of one-dimensional SAXS/SANS data, 
	or generates a model-independent volume fraction profile from the SANS from an 
	adsorbed polymer/surfactant layer.

	A correlation function may be interpreted in terms of an imaginary rod moving 
	through the structure of the material. Î“1D(R) is the probability that a rod of 
	length R moving through the material has equal electron/neutron scattering 
	length density at either end. Hence a frequently occurring spacing within a 
	structure manifests itself as a peak.

	A volume fraction profile \Phi(z) describes how the density of polymer 
	segments/surfactant molecules varies with distance from an (assumed locally flat)
	interface.

      - Fitting of SESANS Data
      	Data from Spin-Echo SANS measurements can now be loaded and fitted. The data will 
	be plotted against the correct axes and models will automatically perform a Hankel 
	transform in order to calculate SESANS from a SANS model.

      - Documentation
      	The documentation has undergone significant checking and updating.

     --------------------
     - Fixes bug #457 that prevented SasView from starting if the user was not
       connected to the internet, or was behind a proxy server.

   - New in Version 3.1.0
     --------------------
     - The documentation/help has had a complete overhaul including:
       - A completely new presentation interface (Sphinx).
       - Proof reading!
       - Updating for latest features.
       - A Help (or sometimes ?) button has been added to every panel, and some
         sub panels if appropriate, linking to the appropriate section in the
         documentation.
       - The model help has been split so that the Details button now brings up
         a very short pop-up giving the equation being used while HELP goes to
         the section in the full documentation describing the model.
       - Extensive help has also been added for the new optimizer engine (see
         below) including rules of thumb on how and when to choose a given
         optimizer and what the parameters do.
     - The optimizer engine has been completely replaced. The new optimizer
       still defaults to the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. However 4
       other optimizers are now also available. Each starts with a set of default
       parameters which can be tuned. The DREAM optimizer takes the longest but
       is the most powerful and yields rich information including full parameter
       correlation and uncertainty plots. A results panel has been added to
       accommodate this.
       - The five new optimizers are:
         - A Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer
         - A Quasi-Newton BFGS optimizer
         - A Nelder-Mead Simplex optimizer
         - A Differential Evolution optimizer
         - A Monte Carlo optimizer (DREAM)
     - New models were added:
         - MicelleSphCoreModel (currently residing in the Uncategorized category)
     - Existing models were updated:
         - LamellarPS (bug in polydispersity integration fixed)
         - RectangularPrismModel
         - RectangularHollowPrismModel
         - RectangularHollowPrismInfThinWallsModel
     - Infrastructure to allow SESANS data to be fit with models was added. This
       will become available in a future release but can currently be used from
       the command line with some caveats.
     - A number of bugs were fixed including a thread crashing issue and an
       incorrect slit smearing resolution calculation.
     - Implemented much more robust error logging to enable much easier
       debugging in general but particularly the debugging of issues reported by
       SasView users.
     - A number of infrastructure tasks under the hood to enhance maintainability
     - Upgrade from Wx 2.8 to Wx 3.0.2 which allows several new features but
       required significant additional rework as well.
     - Fully implemented Sphinx to the build process to produce both better
       user documentation and developer documentation.
     - Restructuring of the code base to more unified nomenclature and structure
       so that the source installation tree more closely matches the installer
       version tree.
     - Code cleanup (an ongoing task) .
     - Migration of the repository to github simplifying contributions from
       non-project personnel through pull requests.

   - New in Version 3.0.0

       RectangularPrismModel, RectangularHollowPrismModel and
       RectangularHollowPrismInfThinWallsModel.
     - The data loader now supports ILL DAT data files and reads the full meta
       information from canSAS file formats.
     - Redefined convention for specifying angular parameters for anisotropic
       models.
     - A number of minor features have been added such as permitting a log
       distribution of points when using a model to simulate data, and the
       addition of a Kratky plot option to the linear plots.
     - A number of bugs have also been fixed.
     - Save Project and Save Analysis now work more reliably.
     - BETA: Magnetic contrast supporting full polarization analysis has been
       implemented for some spherical and cylindrical models.
     - BETA: Two new tools have been added:
       - A generic scattering calculator which takes an atomic, magnetic or
         SLD distribution in space and generates the appropriate 2D
         scattering pattern. In some cases the orientationally averaged
         (powder) 1D scattering can also be computed. Supported formats
         include: SLD or text, PDB, and OMF magnetic moment distribution
         file.
       - An image viewer/converter for data in image format; this reads in
         an image file and will attempt to convert the image pixels to

     -----------------------------------
     - Perspectives Available
       - Invariant calculator: Calculates the invariant, volume fraction, and
         specific surface area.
       - P(r) inversion calculator: Indirect Fourier transformation method.
       - Fitting: the tool used for modeling and fitting 1D and 2D data to
         analytical model functions
       - Tools: provides a number of useful supplementary tools such as SLD
         calculation

     - Fitting
       - Includes a large number of model functions, both form factors and structure factors.
       - Support P(Q)*S(Q) for form factors that flag they can be so multiplied.
       - Supports Gaussian, lognormal, Shulz, rectangular and custom distribution
         functions for models that need to include polydispersity or for orientational
         distributions if appropriate.
       - Anisotropic shapes and magnetic moment modeling in 2D allow for a non-uniform
         distribution of orientations of a given axis leading to modeling and fitting
         capabilities of non azimuthaly symmetric data.
       - User can choose to weight fits or not. If using weights, the user can choose
         the error bar on each point if provided in the file, the square root
         of the intensity or the intensity itself.
       - Instrumental resolution smearing of model or fits is provided with several
         options: read the resolution/point fromt he file. Input a pinhole resolution
         or a slit resolution.
       - Users can define the Qrange (Qmin and Qmax) for both 1D and 2D data for
         fitting and modeling, but not graphically.  The range can be reset to the
         defaults (limits of q in data set for a fit) with the reset button.
       - A mask can be applied to 2D calculation and fitting.
       - Normalized residual plots are provided with every fit.
       - Model function help available through detail button or from the fitting panel.
       - Simultaneous/(advanced)constrained fitting allows for fitting a single
         data set or several different sets simultaneously with the application
         of advanced constraints relating fit parameters to functions of other
         parameters (including from a different set). For example thickness of
         shell = sin(30) times the length.
       - Models that are the sum of two other models can be easily generated through the
         SUM Model menubar item.
       - New Python models can be added on the fly by creating an appropriate Python
         file in the model plugin directory. Two tools are provided to help:
         An easy to use custom model editor allows the quick generation of new Python
         models by supplying only the parameters and their default value (box 1)
         and the mathematical function of the model (box 2) and generating the
         necessary *.py file.  A separate advanced model editor provides a full Python
         file editor.  Either way once saved the model becomes immediately available
         to the application.
       - A batch fitting capability allows for the analysis of a series of data sets to
         a single model and provides the results in a tabular form suitable for saving
         or plotting the evolution of the fit parameters with error bars (from within
         the application).

                previous versions be un-installed prior to installing the
                new version.

   2.1- System Requirements
        - Python version >= 2.5 and < 3.0 should be running on the system
        - We currently use Python 2.7

   2.2- Installing from source
        - Get the source code
          - to follow the current development version from source control use
              git clone https://github.com/SasView/sasview.git
              git clone https://github.com/bumps/bumps.git
	  - to install a specific version

        - Build, install and run a specific release
          - make sure the requirements below are already installed
          - retrieve the source from https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases
          - open a command line window in the 'sasview-x.x.x' directory
          - run 'python setup.py install'
          - run 'python sasview.py' under the 'sasview' folder.

        - Build, install and run the current development version
          - clone the source from git; also clone bumps, which is developed in parallel
              git clone https://github.com/SasView/sasview.git
              git clone https://github.com/bumps/bumps.git
          - open a command line window in the 'sasview' directory
          - run 'python setup.py build'
          - run 'python run.py'; this runs from the source directories, so you
            don't have to rebuild every time you make a change, unless you are
            changing the C++ model files

3- Known Issues
===============


   4.1- All systems:
      The conversion to sasmodels infrastructure is ongoing and should be
      completed in the next release. In the meantime this leads to a few known
      issues:
        - The way that orientation is defined is being refactored to address
        long standing issues and comments.  In release 4.1 however only models
        with symmetry (e.g. a=b) have been converted to the new definitions.
        The rest (a <> b <> c - e.g. parellelepiped) maintain the same
        definition as before and will be converted in 4.2.  Note that
        orientational distribution also makes much more sense in the new
        framework.  The documentation should indicate which definition is being
        used for a given model.
        - The infrastructure currently handles internal conversion of old style
        models so that user created models in previous versions should continue
        to work for now. At some point in the future such support will go away.
        Everyone is encouraged to convert to the new structure which should be
        relatively straight forward and provides a number of benefits. 
        - In that vein, the distributed models and those generated by the new
        plugin model editor are in the new format, however those generated by
        sum|multiply models are the old style sum|multiply models. This should
        also disappear in the near future 
        - The on the fly discovery of plugin models and changes thereto behave
        inconsistently.  If a change to a plugin model does not seem to
        register, the Load Plugin Models (under fitting -> Plugin Model
        Operations) can be used.  However, after calling Load Plugin Models, the
        active plugin will no longer be loaded (even though the GUI looks like
        it is) unless it is a sum|multiply model which works properly.  All
        others will need to be recalled from the model dropdown menu to reload
        the model into the calculation engine.  While it might be annoying it
        does not appear to prevent SasView from working..
        - The model code and documentation review is ongoing. At this time the
        core shell parellelepiped is known to have the C shell effectively fixed
        at 0 (noted in documentation) while the triaxial ellipsoid does not seem
        to reproduce the limit of the oblate or prolate ellipsoid. If errors are
        found and corrected, corrected versions will be uploaded to the
        marketplace. 
   
   3.1- All systems:
        - The documentation window may take a few seconds to load the first time
          it is called. Also, an internet connection is required before
          equations will render properly. Until then they will show in their
          original TeX format.
        - If the documentation window remains stubbornly blank, try installing a
          different browser and set that as your default browser. Issues have
          been noted with Internet Explorer 11.
        - Check for Updates may fail (with the status bar message ' Cannot
          connect to the application server') if your internet connection uses
          a proxy server. Tested resolutions for this are described on the
          website FAQ.
        - The copy and paste functions (^C, ^V) in the batch mode results grid
          require two clicks: one to select the cell and a second to select the
          contents of the cell.
        - The tutorial has not yet been updated and is somewhat out of date
        - Very old computers may struggle to run the 3.x and later releases
        - Polydispersity on multiple parameters included in a simultaneous/
          constrained fit will likely not be correct
        - Constrained/simultaneous fit page does not have a stop button
        - Constrained/simultaneous fit do not accept min/max limits
        - Save project does not store the state of all the windows
        - Loading projects can be very slow
        - Save Project only works once a data set has been associated with
          a model.  Error is reported on status bar.
        - There is a numerical precision problem with the multishell model when
          the iner radius gets large enough (ticket #288)
        - The angular distribution angles are not clearly defined and may in
          some cases lead to incorrect calculations(ticket #332)

   3.2- Windows:
        - If installed to same directory as old version without first removing
          the old version, the old desktop icon will remain but point to the
          new exe version. Likewise all the start menu folders and items will
          have the old name even though pointing to the new version.  Usually
          safest to uninstall old version prior to installing new version anyway.

   3.3- MAC:
        - Application normally starts up hidden. Click icon in Dock to view/use
          application.
        - Multiprocessing does not currently work on MAC OS

   3.4- Linux:
        - Not well tested
